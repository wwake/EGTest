* Make AllPairs versions of all laws
* Test-drive real versions of this
* CheckProperty for various properties
* Figure out best argument order
* Keep eq() ?


Week of Jan 2, 2023

Explore ResultBuilder with our eg class -  but is Example{ eg()  eg()  eg()}.check(code) that much better than check([eg(), eg(), eg()]) { code }  ? Didn't seem so, so we dropped it

Explore a closure-driven form of Arrange-Act-Assert
Make Arrange2 like Act and Assert2, evaluating as it goes
Explore AAA resultBuilder; had trouble identifying our types
Drop the AAA spike

Rename EG => eg (non-standard but I'm seeing if I like it better)

Added an eq() method to get a better message
Added #line and #file for better reporting - make sure that errors report in the user's code
Added eq() to the TestCase extension so we can use it directly

Clean up and consolidate

CheckCommutative 
Combinatorial tests
Symmetric Law
Equivalence Partition

* Clean up parameterized tests package
